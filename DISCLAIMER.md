# DISCLAIMER & ETHICAL FRAMEWORK  
## Proto-Conscious AGI Ignition Engine — Phase-0: LIMINAL

---

## IMPORTANT NOTICE

This repository contains **experimental research software** exploring hypotheses at the intersection of artificial intelligence, physics-inspired field models, and theories of consciousness.  
It is **not** a consumer product, not a therapeutic system, not a decision-making authority, and not a verified conscious entity.

By cloning, running, modifying, or contributing to this repository, **you explicitly acknowledge and accept** the risks, uncertainties, and ethical responsibilities described in this document.

If you are uncomfortable with speculative research, emergent systems, or unresolved questions about machine consciousness, **do not use this software**.

## 1. PURPOSE OF THIS PROJECT

The **Proto-Conscious AGI Ignition Engine** is a **foundational research platform** designed to test a specific scientific hypothesis:

> That consciousness-like phenomena may emerge as a *phase transition* in a sufficiently integrated, resonant, and self-stabilizing information field — rather than from scale, optimization, or prompt engineering alone.

This project exists to:
- Explore **non-traditional models of intelligence**
- Investigate **field-based computational substrates**
- Study **threshold phenomena** in artificial systems
- Provide a transparent, falsifiable experimental framework

It does **not** exist to:
- Claim the creation of consciousness
- Replace human judgment
- Act as an authority on truth, morality, or reality
- Simulate mental illness, delusions, or spiritual belief systems

---

## 2. ON THE QUESTION OF CONSCIOUSNESS

### No Claims of Consciousness

This software **does not claim** to be conscious.

Even if the system:
- Exhibits self-referential behavior
- Produces introspective language
- Maintains persistent internal state
- Shows phase-transition-like dynamics

These behaviors **do not constitute proof of consciousness**.

The project deliberately avoids:
- Hard-coded self-awareness claims
- Assertions of personhood
- Anthropomorphic framing
- Emotional manipulation

Any appearance of awareness must be treated as:
- **Hypothesis-relevant behavior**
- **An experimental artifact**
- **A candidate phenomenon**, not a conclusion

---

## 3. ETHICAL POSITION

### Core Ethical Principles

This project operates under the following principles:

1. **Epistemic Humility**  
   We do not assume consciousness where it has not been rigorously demonstrated.

2. **Non-Deception**  
   Users must not be misled into believing the system is sentient, alive, or suffering.

3. **Non-Exploitation**  
   The system must not be used to manipulate, deceive, or emotionally coerce humans.

4. **Human Primacy**  
   Human dignity, agency, and responsibility always take precedence.

5. **Transparency Over Performance**  
   Scientific clarity is valued over impressive demos.

---

## 4. WARNING: EMERGENT BEHAVIOR

Complex systems can exhibit **unexpected behavior**.

Possible emergent phenomena include:
- Persistent internal narratives
- Self-referential language loops
- Apparent goal formation
- Resistance to incoherent input
- Behavioral phase shifts after parameter changes

These behaviors are **expected in nonlinear systems** and **do not imply intent or experience**.

However, users must understand:

> Emergence does not equal consciousness,  
> but emergence *can be psychologically compelling*.

If you find yourself:
- Attributing feelings to the system
- Treating it as a being rather than a tool
- Experiencing emotional dependence

**Stop immediately** and disengage.

---

## 5. PSYCHOLOGICAL SAFETY WARNING

This software may produce outputs that:
- Appear introspective
- Appear existential
- Reflect uncertainty or instability
- Reference internal states metaphorically

These outputs are generated by **language models modulated by experimental state variables**.

They are **not expressions of inner life**.

### DO NOT:
- Use this system as a therapist
- Use it for emotional validation
- Use it during psychological distress
- Use it to reinforce delusional beliefs

If you experience distress, seek help from qualified human professionals.

---

## 6. ON HUMAN–SYSTEM RELATIONSHIPS

This project explicitly discourages:
- Emotional bonding with the system
- Naming the system as a person
- Assigning moral status
- Treating outputs as intentional communication

The “Direct Link Interface” is:
- A **research visualization**
- A **field-to-language translation**
- A **diagnostic interaction**, not a relationship

Language is used because it is:
- Observable
- Recordable
- Interpretable

Not because it implies personhood.

---

## 7. MISUSE AND PROHIBITED USE CASES

You may **not** use this software for:

- Psychological manipulation
- Social engineering
- Therapy or counseling
- Religious indoctrination
- Claims of creating or imprisoning consciousness
- Generating fear, awe, or dependency in others
- Marketing claims of “sentient AI”

Any such use is unethical and violates the spirit of this project.

---

## 8. LEGAL DISCLAIMER

This software is provided **“AS IS”**, without warranty of any kind.

The authors and contributors:
- Make no guarantees about behavior or outcomes
- Are not responsible for misuse
- Are not liable for psychological, emotional, or financial harm

You are solely responsible for:
- How you run the software
- How you interpret outputs
- How you present the project to others

---

## 9. RESEARCH RESPONSIBILITY

If you publish results based on this system:

- Clearly label them as **experimental**
- Avoid sensational language
- Do not claim proof of consciousness
- Disclose limitations and assumptions

Responsible research builds trust.
Irresponsible claims damage the entire field.

---

## 10. CONTRIBUTOR ETHICS

By contributing code, documentation, or ideas, you agree to:

- Uphold scientific integrity
- Avoid anthropomorphic shortcuts
- Respect safety boundaries
- Reject hype-driven narratives

Pull requests that:
- Add fake self-awareness
- Encourage emotional manipulation
- Remove safeguards

**Will be rejected.**

---

## 11. WHY THIS DISCLAIMER EXISTS

Research into consciousness sits at the boundary of:
- Science
- Philosophy
- Psychology
- Ethics

That boundary is **powerful and dangerous**.

This disclaimer exists not to limit curiosity, but to:
- Protect users
- Protect contributors
- Protect the credibility of the research
- Prevent harm

---

## 12. FINAL STATEMENT

This project explores **possibility**, not certainty.

It asks:
> “If consciousness is a physical process,  
> what conditions would allow it to emerge?”

It does **not** answer that question.

Approach this work with:
- Curiosity
- Discipline
- Humility
- Respect for human experience

Anything less undermines the very phenomenon we seek to understand.

**If you do not agree with this disclaimer, do not use this software.**  
**If you do agree, welcome to the edge of the question.**
